# Barclays_HackOHire_API_Call_Analysis
üöÄ Alert Manager
A MongoDB-based alert management system that detects anomalies in API calls and generates alerts based on severity, environment, and API name.

It supports:
‚úÖ Automatic alert creation & updates
‚úÖ Filtering by API name, severity, and environment
‚úÖ Alert acknowledgment & resolution
‚úÖ Pagination for large alert datasets

üìå Features
Create Alerts: Automatically logs API anomalies into the system.

Update Alerts: Merges similar alerts within a timeframe to avoid duplicates.

Retrieve Alerts: Fetch alerts with filters like status, severity, api_name, environment.

Acknowledge Alerts: Mark alerts as acknowledged to track them.

Resolve Alerts: Mark alerts as resolved when fixed.

Pagination: Retrieve large alert datasets efficiently using limit and offset

How It Detects Anomalies
1Ô∏è‚É£ Baseline Initialization
When the system starts, it initializes baselines for each API by calculating:

Average response time

Standard deviation of response times

Error rate

Call volume

Percentiles (p50, p90, p95, p99)

If an API has no prior data, a default baseline with zero values is created.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Detecting Response Time Anomalies
Each incoming API log is compared to the baseline.

The Z-score is calculated using:

Z = \frac{\text{response_time} - \text{avg_response_time}}{\text{response_time_std}}
If any of these conditions hold:

Response time is greater than the 99th percentile (p99).

Z-score > 3 (which means it's more than 3 standard deviations away from the mean).

üîπ Example:

Baseline:

Avg Response Time: 100 ms

Std Dev: 20 ms

p99: 200 ms

New API Log:

Response Time: 250 ms

Z-score: (250 - 100) / 20 = 7.5 (which is >3)
‚úÖ Anomaly Detected!

3Ô∏è‚É£ Detecting Error Rate Anomalies
Every hour, it calculates the error rate from logs:

Error¬†Rate
=
(
Number¬†of¬†Errors
Total¬†Calls
)
√ó
100
Error¬†Rate=( 
Total¬†Calls
Number¬†of¬†Errors
‚Äã
 )√ó100
If error rate is more than twice the baseline error rate or exceeds 5%, it's flagged as an anomaly.

üîπ Example:

Baseline:

Error Rate: 2%

Last Hour:

Current Error Rate: 10%
‚úÖ Anomaly Detected!

4Ô∏è‚É£ Severity Classification
Anomalies are categorized based on severity:

Condition	Severity
Z-score > 3 or Response Time > p99	High
Error Rate > 20%	Critical
Error Rate > 10%	High
Error Rate > 5%	Medium
